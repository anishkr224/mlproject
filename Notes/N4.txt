Lec: 274 - ML Project Deployment Using AWS Beanstalk

Two important configurations are required when working with Elastic Beanstalk, which provides an instance where you can deploy your entire application.

1. It tells the Elastic Beanstalk instance, what the entry point of your application is. By default, according to Elastic Beanstalk documentation, the configuration looks like this:

.ebextensions\python.config

option_settings:
  "aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:python":
    WSGIPath: application:application

- Option setting for AWS Elastic Beanstalk container specifies Python as the platform (This is specifically for Python containers; Docker has a different process).
- Specify the WSGI path with the application name. This application should be your app.py filename (in case of Student Performance Prediction Project), which is the entry point of your application.
- It is compulsory that inside this Python config file, you specify the entry point in the format application:application.

2. However, I do not have an application.py file. So, I copied the code from app.py and created a new file named application.py just for deployment purposes. I pasted the same code there and removed debug=True because when deploying, debug mode should always be disabled.

git add .
git status
git commit -m "Deployment Configuration"
git push -u origin main


AWS Elastic Beanstalk only supports certain Python platform versions, and since Python 3.8 is end-of-life, AWS doesn’t provide it anymore. That’s why i have to upgrade it to Python 3.10

git add .
git status
git commit -m "upgrade to python 3.10"
git push -u origin main
